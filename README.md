# Healthcare Disease Coding API (ICD-11 & AYUSH)

## Overview
A Flask-based healthcare backend application that provides disease coding
and classification using ICD-11 and AYUSH (NAMASTE) codes through a local API.

This project demonstrates how modern healthcare systems can map traditional
AYUSH terminology with standardized ICD-11 disease classifications.

## Key Features
- ICD-11 disease code integration
- AYUSH / NAMASTE disease code mapping
- Autocomplete disease suggestion API
- REST-style JSON endpoints
- Patient & prescription management
- SQLite lightweight database
- Flask backend with modular routing

## Why This Project?
Healthcare systems require accurate disease classification for diagnosis,
prescription, and reporting. This project bridges the gap between traditional
AYUSH diagnosis and modern ICD-11 standards using a backend API approach.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- SQLite
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- CSV-based disease dataset
